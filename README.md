# Hi, my name is George 👋

## About Me
I am a 2nd year student majoring in "Information and Analytical Security Systems".
My main professional passion is **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, and I am purposefully developing towards the role of ML Engineer.

## 🏗️ My Projects (academic and in progress)
This is where I apply theory to practice. So far, these are mostly academic assignments.

*   **Classical ML tasks:** Worked with the basics on the `Iris` and `Titanic` datasets. Understand the full cycle: from EDA to model selection.
*   **Neural network for audio emotion classification (in progress):** A university project. First experience working with neural networks and audio processing.
*   **Planned / In progress:** A pet project on network traffic analysis using ML/neural networks to find anomalies. I want to combine my interest in ML with my InfoSec specialty.
*   **Kaggle:** Currently just exploring the platform. The immediate goal is to figure out how to properly format solutions and participate in the first competition.

*(Projects are gradually being published on GitHub as I refactor the code and learn Git.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills
**Languages:** Python, Matlab  
**ML/DL:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn  
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm  
**In the process of learning:** Git & GitHub — learning through practice by publishing my projects.

## 📈 Goals and Plans
**Now:** Consolidate skills through practical tasks. Convert academic projects into public repositories.

**Main goal for the year:** Find my first internship or a Junior-level position in the field of Machine Learning / Data Science, where I can grow under the guidance of experienced mentors.
